                        <p>My first job that I ever had was working on a landscaping crew. While the work was menial and monotonous, I learned that hard work is often just that; putting your shoulder to the wheel and pushing along. It doesn't matter what job you are working at, it only matter the discipline and effort you put into it. I learned those valuable skills while pulling, mowing, scraping, digging, and pruning.</p>
                        <p>For my second job, I decided to switch things up and work in the fast food industry. I worked at the BYU creamery near Heritage Halls and I learned another important lesson. I learned the importance of networking with your coworkers and making friends. Work is so much better when you are smiling and working with people you enjoy being around. I learned to smile at customers and try to be an enjoyable person to be around.</p>
                        <p>I really enjoyed my third job and not just because we had an amazing snack room. I was able to work with my cousin as an accounts payable clerk. I developed office skills in this job such as emailing, printing, sorting, indexing, and accounting. This job taught me that consistency and timeliness are two vital aspects of business. We had many venders that relied on me and those I worked with to get paid.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I worked as a door-to-door salesman selling pest control in Oklahoma. If there was any job that taught me to work hard, it was this job. I learned to work hard, long hours and to find ways to make it enjoyable. I also learned that customer service is the most important thing in sales.</p>
